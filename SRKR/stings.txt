story = "   Once upon a the TIME in a distant village, there lived a wise coder named Python. He was respected for his WISDOM, logic, and power. python often said: 'the Code is poetry!'   "
Tasks:
1. The story feels cluttered — clean the unnecessary surroundings.
2. The elders say Python should never be spoken in uppercase — make the name more humble.
3. All wisdom must begin in quiet tone — make the whole story soft-spoken.
4. You’re preparing a title for a scroll — turn it into a proper title.
5. The master hates loudness — remove every occurrence of "WISDOM" and replace it with "clarity".
6. Count how many times our master Python is mentioned (regardless of how it is written).
7. Is it true that the story begins with silence? Prove it.
8. Is there truth in the final words? Confirm if they end with a poetic mark.
9. Extract the ancient quote Python said — it's between the single quotes.
10. Find where the word "power" first appears, and where the word "the" last appears.
11. The High Council wants a banner — take only the first 12 symbols.
12. They also need the last 15 symbols for a secret seal.
13. There’s a hidden code in the middle — extract every second character from position 10 to 50.
14. To read the tale backward — reverse the story completely.
15. Break the story into its words, and count how many parts you get.
16. Some of the wisdom was stored in comma-separated runes — split those too.
17. Join the words using a sacred rune: `-` (dash).
18. Count how often the letter of enlightenment (‘e’) appears in the story.
19. The scroll must begin with "Once" — verify that.
20. The scroll must end with "poetry!'" — check that too.
21. There is a word “Code” — but is it pure? Is it alphabetic only? (Clean it first)
22. Check if a number like `"123456"` is considered holy — is it purely numeric?
23. Show how long the purified scroll is after trimming.
24. Write a code snippet that changes all `" "` (spaces) to underscores to preserve spacing in ancient runes.
25. Finally, form a password using: the first 3 letters, the last 3 letters, and the length of the final story.
